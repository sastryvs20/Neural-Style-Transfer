# Neural-Style-Transfer

Neural style transfer is deep learning technique that allows us to combine the conents of one image with the other in order to create completely new artistic style immages. This can be achieved by deep neural networks to learn the statistical featues of 2 images. The neural network is then used to generate a new image that has the content of the first image and style of the second. This technique was introduced in the paper 'A neural algorithm of artistic style' by Gatys et al in 2015. The original paper can be accessed from https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576.
